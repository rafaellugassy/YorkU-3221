1)
Start routine, found on the man page "pthread_create" and "pthreads(7)"

2)
Mutexes - mutual exclusion lock.  Prevents the access to data inside the lock to be accessed by more than one thread, as this may cause unexpected errors. 

Joins - waits for the thread to terminate to continue in the main thread.

Condition Variables - allows conditions to be met before a thread can continue its actions.
man page "pthreads(7)"

3)
a thread may be awoken from it's waiting state without a thread signalling the condition variable.  on the man page "pthread_cond_wait"

4)
The thread that will execute first would be the one is based on its scheduling policy, they race, and the first thread will be the one to execute. man "phread_cond_signal"

5)
A deadlock will occur (no threads will be able to continue through the mutex)
man page "pthread_mutex_lock" and "pthread_cond_wait"

6)
A detatched thread is a thread that doesn't have to be joined, and will imediately will release its resources as it terminates. on the man page "pthread_detach"
